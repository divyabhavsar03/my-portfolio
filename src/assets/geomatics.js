        s_desc:"This project was done in ArcGIS Pro. Here I made use of GeoProcessing Tool called Hydrology. This project analyzes Calgaryâ€™s watershed and stream networks using GIS and remote sensing. By getting the Digital Elevation Model (DEM), I identified sinks, flow direction, flow accumulation, and stream networks extracting the key watershed basins for hydrological analysis. Using ArcGIS Pro, I applied raster processing, stream ordering, and basin delineation to visualize water flow and its impact on the environment. This study aids in flood risk assessment, urban planning, and water resource management. ",

I compared the classified raster images of Calgary from two different years 2014 and 2024, and applied Categorical Change Detection to identify the changes or transformation in land cover. Using ArcGIS Pro, I processed satellite imagery, ran change detection analysis, and generated a classified raster highlighting area of change. This study helps in urban development planning, environmental monitoring, and resource management. ",

By mapping fire station locations and road networks, I applied the buffer tool to determine service areas. A 3.5 km buffer per station showed that nearly the entire city is covered, ensuring efficient emergency response. The blue areas show the coverage, whereas the red areas show the lack of coverage. This study helps in urban planning, optimizing emergency services, and identifying potential coverage gaps. ",

I processed composite imagery, extracted the study area, and applied supervised classification using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm in ArcGIS Pro. After classification, I converted the raster to a polygon dataset, merged similar classes using the dissolve tool, and calculated the area for each land cover type. This study provides insights into urban expansion, environmental changes, and resource management. ",
